Q1. Implementation of Dense Vector Word Embeddings using Word2Vec Models (Skip-gram and CBOW) with Interactive Streamlit Application

Program Description
This laboratory exercise implements dense vector word embeddings using Word2Vec models, specifically the Skip-gram and Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) architectures. The implementation includes a comprehensive Streamlit web application that allows users to train both models, analyze word similarities, and visualize embeddings in 2D space. The program demonstrates fundamental concepts in neural language modeling, negative sampling optimization, and semantic vector representations. Users can input custom text corpora, configure training parameters, and explore the learned word relationships through interactive visualizations and similarity searches.

Program Logic
Libraries
- streamlit (for interactive web application interface)
- numpy (for numerical computations and matrix operations)
- pandas (for data manipulation and analysis)
- matplotlib.pyplot (for plotting and visualization)
- seaborn (for advanced statistical visualizations)
- sklearn.decomposition.PCA (for dimensionality reduction)
- sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity (for similarity calculations)
- collections.Counter (for frequency counting)
- random (for random number generation and sampling)
- time (for performance measurement)
- io.StringIO (for string input/output operations)

Data Types
- Strings for text corpus, sentences, and individual words
- Lists for storing sentences, vocabulary, and training pairs
- Dictionaries for word-to-index and index-to-word mappings
- NumPy arrays for embedding matrices, gradients, and similarity calculations
- Floats for learning rates, similarity scores, and loss values
- Integers for indices, dimensions, epochs, and vocabulary sizes
- Tuples for training pairs (center-context word pairs)

Core Functions and Methods

1. Text Preprocessing Functions:
   - preprocess_corpus(): Tokenizes text, builds vocabulary, creates word mappings
   - generate_training_pairs_skipgram(): Creates (center, context) pairs for Skip-gram
   - generate_training_pairs_cbow(): Creates (context_list, target) pairs for CBOW

2. Model Training Functions:
   - train_skipgram(): Implements Skip-gram training with negative sampling
   - train_cbow(): Implements CBOW training with negative sampling
   - sigmoid(): Applies sigmoid activation with numerical stability

3. Analysis Functions:
   - find_nearest_words(): Computes cosine similarity for word similarity search
   - plot_embeddings_pca(): Visualizes embeddings in 2D using PCA
   - plot_similarity_heatmap(): Creates similarity matrices for selected words

4. Neural Network Components:
   - Input embeddings (W_in): Maps words to dense vectors
   - Output embeddings (W_out): Context prediction weights
   - Negative sampling: Efficient training optimization
   - Gradient descent: Parameter updates with backpropagation

Training Process:
1. Initialize random embedding matrices for input and output layers
2. Create negative sampling probability distribution based on word frequencies
3. For each training pair:
   - Compute positive sample probability using sigmoid
   - Sample negative examples and compute their probabilities
   - Calculate gradients for both positive and negative samples
   - Update embedding matrices using gradient descent
4. Track training loss and model convergence

Key Features Demonstrated:
1. Neural language model implementation from scratch using NumPy
2. Negative sampling optimization for efficient training (reduces computational complexity from O(V) to O(k) where k is number of negative samples)
3. Dense vector representations capturing semantic relationships between words
4. Interactive web interface for model experimentation and real-time parameter tuning
5. Real-time visualization of embedding spaces using PCA dimensionality reduction
6. Comparative analysis between Skip-gram and CBOW architectures
7. Customizable hyperparameters (embedding dimensions, learning rate, epochs, window size)
8. Cosine similarity-based word relationship analysis with nearest neighbor search
9. Comprehensive evaluation through similarity searches and word clustering
10. Professional-grade Streamlit application with multiple analysis modes

Technical Implementation Details:
- Skip-gram Architecture: Predicts context words from center word (1-to-many prediction)
- CBOW Architecture: Predicts center word from context words (many-to-1 prediction)
- Negative Sampling: Uses word frequency^0.75 distribution for efficient training
- Gradient Descent: Manual implementation of backpropagation with learning rate scheduling
- Numerical Stability: Sigmoid function with clipping to prevent overflow/underflow
- Memory Efficiency: Sparse matrix operations and optimized NumPy array operations

Application Usage:
To run the Dense Vector application:
```bash
cd "Dense Vector (embedding)"
streamlit run Dense_Vector_App.py
```

The application provides three main sections:
1. Model Training: Configure parameters and train both Skip-gram and CBOW models
2. Word Similarity: Search for similar words and compare model outputs
3. Visualization: PCA plots, similarity heatmaps, and word clustering analysis

Performance Metrics:
- Training Speed: Optimized with vectorized operations and negative sampling
- Memory Usage: Efficient sparse representations for large vocabularies
- Accuracy: Semantic relationships captured through cosine similarity measures
- Scalability: Configurable parameters allow adaptation to different corpus sizes
