# NLP Coursework Overview

This repository contains practical materials and resources for key topics in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The organization of files and folders reflects the major concepts covered in the coursework, each with supporting code and reference documents.

## Importance of This Work

Natural Language Processing is a foundational field in artificial intelligence, enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. The concepts and exercises in this repository are essential for building skills in text analysis, information extraction, and language modeling, which are critical for applications such as search engines, chatbots, translation systems, and more.

## Concepts Covered

### 1. Text Processing and Regular Expression
- Techniques for cleaning, parsing, and manipulating text data.
- Use of regular expressions for pattern matching and extraction.

### 2. Edit Distance and Applications
- Algorithms for measuring similarity between strings (e.g., Levenshtein distance).
- Applications in spell checking, DNA sequence analysis, and plagiarism detection.

### 3. N-gram, POS Tagging, and Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- N-gram models for language modeling and text prediction.
- Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging for grammatical analysis.
- Named Entity Recognition for extracting entities like names, dates, and locations.

### 4. Word Sense Disambiguation
- Methods for determining the correct meaning of a word in context.
- Importance in improving search, translation, and information retrieval.

### 5. Sparse Vectors
- Representation of text data using sparse vectors for efficient storage and computation.
- Applications in document classification and clustering.
